# ts-node-init CLI

Hello! This is a simple CLI to initiate a minimal setup to begin a nodejs project with typescript. I did this because I wanted to know how to build a CLI in with nodejs and how to publish a npm module. Features will come when I need them :kissing_heart:

## Installation

```
npm install -g tsni
```

## Usage

```
tsni
```
